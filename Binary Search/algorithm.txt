Binary search is an algorithm to search a specific element in an Array.
While brute forcing we use all the elements we pick from one side.
But if an array is sorted, then picking from middle element is going to eliminate half of the elements.

complexity:
    linear search will take cN time and c' space
    so time complexity is O(N) and space complexity O(1)
    Binary search will take cN/2 time

array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
quary = 7
algorithm is:
    if query == array[middle]: // middle is 5
        return middle 
    elif query > array[middle]: // 7>5
        eliminate first half of array
        and repeat process from if
    else:
        eliminate last half of array
        and repeat process from if
